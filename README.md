#Readme file for react code

#loading the code
This code can be easily loaded using expo.dev, which allows react native code to be loaded on a web browser.
Once the code is on snack, you can use the url that loads on the website to get to our project using the expo app on your phone
from there, the app should be loaded and compatible with both iOS and android

#working the app
the app will load to a sign in page. All text entries can be filled out, and there are two possible test cases

#test 1 passwords do not match
once the return button is pressed for the confirm password entry, if the passwords don't match, an error alert will show up

#test 2 passwords do match
once the return button is pressed for the confirm password entry, if the passwords match, everything goes accordingly.
